abstract: We characterise proper morphisms of infinity-topoi in terms of a relativised notion of compactness: we show that a geometric morphism of infinity-topoi is proper if and only if it commutes with colimits indexed by filtered internal infinity-categories in the target. In particular, our result implies that for any infinity-topos, the global sections functor is proper if and only if it preserves filtered colimits. As an application, we show that every proper and separated map of topological spaces gives rise to a proper morphism between the associated sheaf infinity-topoi, generalising a result of Lurie. Along the way, we develop some aspects of the theory of localic higher topoi internal to an infinity-topos, which might be of independent interest.
