abstract: We develop the theory of presentable categories internal to an infinity-topos B. We provide several characterisations of these, including a description in terms of the assoiated sheaves of infinity-categories as well as an internal analogue of the Lurie-Simpson characterisation of presentable infinity-categories. We furthermore establish various structural results about presentable internal categories, such as adjoint functor theorems and a symmetric monoidal structure.
