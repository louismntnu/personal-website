abstract: We develop some basic concepts in the theory of higher categories internal to an arbitrary infinity-topos. We define internal left and right fibrations and prove a version of the Grothendieck construction and of Yoneda's lemma for internal categories.

abstract: We develop a number of basic concepts in the theory of categories internal to an infinity-topos. We discuss adjunctions, limits and colimits as well as Kan extensions for internal categories, and we use these results to prove the universal property of internal presheaf categories. We furthermore construct the free cocompletion of an internal category by colimits that are indexed by an arbitrary class of diagram shapes.

abstract: We develop the theory of presentable categories internal to an infinity-topos B. We provide several characterisations of these, including a description in terms of the associated sheaves of infinity-categories as well as an internal analogue of the Lurie-Simpson characterisation of presentable âˆž-categories. For the latter, we develop a theory of internal filteredness and study the associated notion of accessible internal categories. We furthermore establish various structural results about presentable internal categories, such as adjoint functor theorems and a symmetric monoidal structure. We use the latter to identify the infinity-category of presentable infinity-categories which are tensored over B as a full subcategory of the infinity-category of presentable internal categories in B. We provide two applications of our framework: in the first, we derive a general version of Diaconescu's theorem for infinity-topoi. In the second, we characterise dualisable objects in the infinity-category of modules over an E-infinity-ring in B as internally compact objects.

abstract: We develop the theory of topoi internal to an arbitrary infinity-topos B. We provide several characterisations of these, including an internal analogue of Lurie's characterisation of infinity-topoi, but also a description in terms of the underlying sheaves of infinity-categories, and we prove a number of structural results about these objects. Furthermore, we show that the infinity-category of topoi internal to B is equivalent to the infinity-category of infinity-topoi over B, and use this result to derive a formula for the pullback of infinity-topoi. Lastly, we use our theory to relate smooth geometric morphisms of infinity-topoi to internal locally contractible topoi.
